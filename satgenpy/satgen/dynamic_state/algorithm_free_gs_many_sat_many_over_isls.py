    FREE GROUND STATION (MANY) SATELLITE (MANY) OVER INTER-SATELLITE LINKS ALGORITHM

    "gs_many"
    This algorithm assumes that every ground station has many GSL interfaces.

    "sat_many"
    This algorithm assumes that every satellite has exactly <number of ground stations> GSL interfaces.

    "free"
    The 1 GSL interface is free to whichever satellite it wants.
    A GSL interface in a satellite is only used to send to one ground station.
    This means effectively that the bandwidth a ground station can receive is the amount it can send at, always.

    "only_over_isls"
    It calculates a forwarding state, which is essentially a single shortest path.
    It only considers paths which go over the inter-satellite network, and does not make use of ground
    stations relay. This means that every path looks like:
    (src gs) - (sat) - (sat) - ... - (sat) - (dst gs)
