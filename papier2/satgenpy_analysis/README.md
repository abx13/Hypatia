# Satgenpy analysis

Given that you have generated the satellite network state data over time in `satellite_networks_state`,
here is a theoretical analysis of the commodities rtts and paths .


## Getting started

1. Make sure you have all dependencies installed as prescribed in `<hypatia>/satgenpy/README.md`

2. Perform the full analysis (takes some time) from above directory in paper2.sh

3. The analysis for each constellation is now in `data/<satellite network name>`
